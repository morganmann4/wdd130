                "<em>Oh, woah, </em>
                 <em>Oh, woah, </em>
                 <em>Oh, woah. </em>
              
                
                You know you love me, I know you care. 
                Just shout whenever and I'll be there. 
                You want my love, you want my heart. 
                And we will never, ever, ever be apart. 
                Are we an item? Girl, quit playin' 
                We're just friends, what are you sayin'? 
                Said "There's another," and looked right in my eyes. 
                My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like: 


                Baby, baby, baby oh, 
                Like baby, baby, baby no. 
                Like baby, baby, baby oh. 
                Thought you'd always be mine, mine. 
                Baby, baby, baby oh. 
                Like baby, baby, baby no. 
                Like baby, baby, baby oh. 
                Thought you'd always be mine, mine. "
