            <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
            <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit 
                to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make 
                one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with 
                side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating 
                scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river 
                variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

            <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
            <img src='images/rafting-utah.jpg' alt='rafting in Utah' class='river-img'/>
            <p> Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river 
                flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, 
                and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid 
                (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence
                of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class 
                II/III and is usually done in 6 days. Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
                This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

            <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
            <p> Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was 
                given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the 
                number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never 
                left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly 
                sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in 
                the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the 
                United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, 
                and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to 
                appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>
